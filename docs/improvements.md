   - Middleware for webhook processing

4. **Multi-channel Support**
   - Extend the design to support other messaging channels
   - Allow for unified messaging across WhatsApp, SMS, etc.
   - Message templating system that works across channels

## Developer Experience

1. **Better Documentation**
   - More comprehensive API documentation
   - Tutorials for common use cases
   - Video guides for setup and integration

2. **Development Tools**
   - Add mock server for local testing without WhatsApp API
   - Console commands for common tasks
   - Artisan commands for template management

3. **Configuration Wizard**
   - Interactive setup process for new installations
   - Configuration validation and testing

4. **Testing Improvements**
   - More comprehensive test suite
   - Mocks and fixtures for testing
   - Integration tests with WhatsApp API sandbox

## Reliability & Maintenance
